# Prediction-of-BigMart-Sales-using-Multiple-Linear-Regression
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.
# Methodology
<pre>
Data Preprocessing: Imputed missing values. To have unique values of the same type for instance, in the data there were categories
                    like Low Fat, low fat, and LF which all means the same.
                 </pre>
Performed data visualization.  
Encoded the categorical columns.  
Split the data into training and testing data into 80% and 20%.  
Used multiple linear regression for prediction.
For evaluation parameters project uses metrics like Accuaracy and R-square.
# Result:
The accuracy of the model is between 50-53%.
